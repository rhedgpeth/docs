= Couchbase.Lite.Mapping: A New Couchbase Labs Nuget Package for Couchbase Mobile

The link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/Couchbase.Lite/[Couchbase.Lite] and link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise/[Couchbase.Lite.Enterprise] Nuget packages provide a broad array of capibilities for easily creating, configuring, and manipulating the data within **Couchbase Lite** databases on multiple platforms. While the packages contain a large amount of functionality there are features that still have yet to be implemented. One example is the ability to dynamically convert objects to and from `MutableDocument` objects. Currently, as seen below, each model object property must be added manually to `MutableDocument` objects through various type-specific methods. 

[source,c#]
----
var mutableDocument = new MutableDocument();
mutableDocument.SetString("Name", userProfile.Name);
mutableDocument.SetString("Email", userProfile.Email);
----

Subsequently, to map a `MutableDocument` back into the original object the following must be done.

[source,c#]
----
var userProfile = new UserProfile
{
    Name = document.GetString("Name"),
    Email = document.GetString("Email")
};
----

As you can see the code for converting an object into a `MutableDocument` and back again is simple, but as every object must be mapped developers can find themselves writing many similar lines of code. So, it's with much excitement that link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs[Couchbase Labs] is introducing a new Nuget package to help decrease the amount of code written to map model objects to and from `MutableDocument` objects. 

[source,c#]
----
var userProfile = new UserProfile 
{
    Name = "Robert Hedgpeth",
    Email = "robert.hedgpeth@couchbase.com"
};

// Converting an object to a MutableDocument
var mutableDocument = userProfile.ToMutableDocument();

// Converting a MutableDocument to an object
var newUserProfile = mutableDocument.ToObject<UserProfile>();
----

link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/Couchbase.Lite.Mapping[Couchbase.Lite.Mapping can be found on Nuget.org], and is a completely open-source project maintained in link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/[Couchbase Labs on Github]. It is important to note that the `Couchbase.Lite.Mapping` library is not officially supported by Couchbase, Inc., but is, instead, a community effort. Please give it a try, and let us know what you think! 

Also, as this is an ongoing effort, **please feel free to contribute** by submitting comments, issues, and/or pull-requests.
