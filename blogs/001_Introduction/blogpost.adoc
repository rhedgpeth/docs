Greetings all! I'm Rob Hedgpeth, and I recently joined the Couchbase team as a developer advocate focusing on mobile and IoT. I'm really excited to be joining the team, and figured I would seize the opportunity to [.line-through]#tell some embarrassing stuff about# introduce myself.

I've been slinging code since the early 2000's. Like many others, I started my journey by building pretty horrendous looking websites. Fortunately, for the world, I've since evolved and branched out to a variety of projects across the web, desktop, mobile, and IoT world. I've contributed to the architecture and development of many mobile apps across all of the major platforms, spanning a variety of different industries. I'm passionate about learning new technologies, and am always eager to try out something new.

Joining Couchbase has presented me with a lot to learn, and like many of you I've been hitting up Stack Overflow, Medium, and, of course, this blog to learn as much as I can. Couchbase technologies has an abundance of potential, and I'm anxious to see what we, as a community, can accomplish!

During my free time you can find me tinkering around with some new tech, getting utterly dismantled on a video game, or trying to control the chaos that are my dogs!
